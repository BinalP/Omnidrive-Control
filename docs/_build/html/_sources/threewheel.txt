Three Wheel Omnidrive
=====================
A three wheel omnidrive consists of three omniwheels mounted on a chasis and giving the wheels a correct set of RPM can make the robot move in all directions. Normally, the wheels are mounted near the periphery of the chasis and also the angle between the wheel/motor mountings is kept equilavent i.e. 120°
